Lily (Xianling) Zhang is a Machine Learning Research Scientist at Ford Autonomy, Palo Alto, CA, located at [Ford Greenfield Labs, Stanford Research Park](https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/silicon-valley.html). She is working on Perception and Prediction for autonomous driving tasks.

My research interests include 
- 3D perception and motion prediction
- Geometric scene understanding based data manipulation(scene relighting) to significantly improve the performance of SOTA CenterTrack algorithm.
- Dataset bias identification using perceptual similarity based data clustering for large scale dataset meta labeling, similar data searching, balanced data selection for training set curation.
- Image synthesize using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) and 3D game engines that achieves consistent improvement over multple autonomous driving task: parking slot detection, highway lane segmentation, and monodepth estimation.
